        "The new large button uses existing UI components (shadcn Button) and is visually comparable in prominence to other primary CTAs (e.g., size=\"lg\").",
        "Layout remains responsive: the button is easily tappable and does not overlap other content on small screens."

Use the existing shadcn-ui Button component to match other CTAs (e.g., size=\"lg\") and apply responsive layout classes (e.g., keep within the existing flex-wrap group and ensure it remains comfortably tappable on small screens). Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
