  "summary": "Implemented a single-route PhysioTrack landing page with a Daily Check-in flow, scoring utilities, and a warm earth-tone theme; however, the required generated image assets are not shown as added, and Internet Identity/auth-related scaffolding was introduced despite being a stated non-goal.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Add generated static image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated with the exact filenames and render them on the page.",
      "reason": "The landing page references the generated image paths, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the AC about the files being present cannot be verified from the diff.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/PhysioTrackLanding.tsx (references /assets/generated/physiotrack-mark.dim_512x512.png and /assets/generated/physiotrack-hero.dim_1600x900.png)"
